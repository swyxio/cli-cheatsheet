# cli-cheatsheet

helpful libraries and resources for *building* Node.js CLIs. Not [a list of CLIs](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps).

I put together a 90 minute Egghead.io [Course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-custom-cli-tooling-with-oclif-and-typescript?af=95qfq1) and [Workshop](https://github.com/sw-yx/egghead-cli-workshop/) on how to put these tools together, if you like video learning. I also make some money if you watch those videos if you want to help :)

## CLI Design Thinking

- **12 Factor CLI Apps** ([Blogpost](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izx3-KSuaM8)): Jeff Dickey's list of requirements for UX.

- **Heroku CLI Style Guide** ([Guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cli-style-guide), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHiDG-_XoRk), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ud5MkVN_s)): Heroku's CLI Style Guide. 

- **CLI Guidelines** ([Guide](https://clig.dev/), [Source](https://github.com/cli-guidelines/cli-guidelines)): An open-source guide to help you write better command-line programs, taking traditional UNIX principles and updating them for the modern day.

- **[The Poetics of CLI Command Names](https://smallstep.com/blog/the-poetics-of-cli-command-names/)**: Command naming anti-patterns and excellent names

- **CLI State Machines** ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/3af1e264b8460af8897768045b2c229f)): My little thoughts on state management

- **Add a dry run mode for expensive commands** like [gatsby dry-run](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/16384)

## Utility Libraries

### Performance Optimization

- [@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/152/) ([twitter tip](https://mobile.twitter.com/thymikee/status/1092885415365877760))
- [@salesforce/lazy-require](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@salesforce/lazy-require)
- [v8-compile-cache](https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache)

For performance logging, you can try `process.htime()` instead of `console.time()` (altho the latter uses the former under the hood)

### Update Management/Nagging

- https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier#readme

### Context/Config

**Context from Git/CI**

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-ci
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-repo-info

  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/precinct


**Config validation**

- https://github.com/hapijs/joi used by React Native CLI for validation
- yup
- validate.js
- json-schema https://simonplend.com/how-can-you-handle-request-validation-in-your-express-based-api/
- https://ajv.js.org/ https://twitter.com/ArrowoodTech/status/1324424901458120704
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-validate from Jest but not Jest specific

**Loading config from json, rc file, etc***

- https://github.com/DavidWells/configorama
- https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig Find and load configuration from a package.json property, rc file, or CommonJS module. [Check `searchPaths` to implement XDG spec compliance.](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig/issues/152)
  - replaces https://github.com/dominictarr/rc, an old rc-file finder with some different design choices

*don't need but nice to know: https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-package-json*

> Beware the race condition when you check if file exists and then open it. the file could be deleted in betwee. instead, just open the file and handle the error if it doesnt exist.

**Loading/Storing config from a persistent store**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware of [the XDG spec](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). Sindre's libraries use [`env-paths`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-paths#pathsconfig) to get paths compliant with this.

- https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf simple config storing (maybe try [conf-cli](https://github.com/natzcam/conf-cli) to manipulate if needed) the successor to [configstore](https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf#how-is-this-different-from-configstore)
- https://github.com/jonschlinkert/data-store conf like datastore but in the shclinkerverse

### üåüInput

- https://npm.im/enquirer (recommended)
  - combine with https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzy for fuzzy matching
- https://npm.im/inquirer
- https://npm.im/prompts
- https://npm.im/email-prompt

**Stdin Parsing**

- https://npm.im/get-stdin (eg when you want to receive pipe results `cat mydata.json | mycli`)

**Argument Parsing**

- https://npm.im/meow
- https://npm.im/arg
- https://npm.im/minimist (hasn't been updated in a while though)
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cliclopts

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your framework may come with parsing built in

**Input/Stdin/Argument Processing**

make sure to also normalize inputted stuff before you compare

- `path.resolve(str1) === path.resolve(str2)`
- https://npm.im/normalize-url
- https://github.com/sindresorhus/compare-urls

### üåüProcessing

**Command execution**

- https://npm.im/shelljs - xplatform shell command execution
- https://npm.im/cross-spawn (also a cross platform solution to node's spawn and spawnSync)
- https://npm.im/execa (recommended)
  - execa best practices: 
    - use `preferLocal: true`
    - try not to mix streams and promises. use `stdio: 'inherit'` to pipe stdout/stderr up
    - [avoid `shell: true` unless absolutely necessary](https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa#shell)

Remember Windows users for cross-platform nodejs ([Guide](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-node-guide/blob/master/docs/4_terminal/shell.md#cmdexe)). e.g. dont execute pkg.json or shell commands with single quotes instead of escaped double quotes

Sometimes processes can spawn processes. This is troublesome for watch/reload features. Kill them all with [`tree-kill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tree-kill).

You'll probably also use these in conjunction with port monitors (e.g. the process you're working with opens a port, like CRA for [Netlify Dev](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin/)):

- https://github.com/Rich-Harris/port-authority#readme
- https://github.com/mikeal/getport#readme
- https://github.com/sindresorhus/get-port#readme

If child_processes are going to be a key part of your CLI, be sure to [read the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) and [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-js-child-processes-everything-you-need-to-know-e69498fe970a/) to be aware of the API.

You may also want to poll for conditions to be true to execute async processes:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-wait-for

**Spinners/Loaders**

- https://npm.im/ora (recommended)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-ux#cliaction
- http://npm.im/log-update Log by overwriting the previous output in the terminal. Useful for rendering progress bars, animations, etc.
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-spinners
- https://npm.im/listr for progress lists
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/progress-estimator remembers previous execution times, estimates them next time

**Templating**

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-template-dir
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/consolidate
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs (Gluegun has this built in)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/pupa (sindresorhus' templating)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/replace-string (string replace with multiple matches)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpy (copy files using streams)
- Mustache and handlebars https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars
- Liquid templating (from Shopify) https://github.com/Shopify/liquid
- https://github.com/amwmedia/plop: "basically glue code between inquirer prompts and handlebar templates"
- Angular Schematics https://angular.io/guide/schematics
- Yeoman generator https://yeoman.io/
  - specifically you can just use the filesystem commands https://yeoman.io/authoring/file-system.html

**Temp folders**

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/tempy (create unique temp directories)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmp (very popular. can remove on exit)

### üåüOutput

**Files**

- ensure directory exists: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13542667/create-directory-when-writing-to-file-in-node-js
  - simple replacement for `fs.existsSync(path.resolve/path.join)` http://npm.im/path-exists
  - also https://www.npmjs.com/package/make-dir
- encrypt files: https://medium.com/@brandonstilson/lets-encrypt-files-with-node-85037bea8c0e
- writing large files: https://www.npmjs.com/package/write-file-atomic
- navigating node_modules using the same package npm uses: https://github.com/npm/arborist/

**Icons & Coloring**

- https://npm.im/chalk (recommended - also see [Related Packages](https://github.com/chalk/chalk#related))
- https://npm.im/kleur
- https://npm.im/cfonts
- https://npm.im/tinycolor2 (some interesting APIs, handy with React Ink)
- https://npm.im/log-symbols (colored xplatform unicode symbols for success/info/warning/error)
- https://npm.im/figures (Unicode symbols with Windows CMD fallbacks)
- https://npm.im/gradient-string VERY nice color gradient text

Note that you may want to offer the option to [FORCE_COLOR](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1166431071711498240) in CI logging.

**PrettyPrinting**

- https://npm.im/pretty-bytes
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettyjson

**Banners**

- https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js - helps sets width dependent on terminal size

**Debug Logging**

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug (note that you might not need this, Node's inbuilt [`util.debuglog`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_debuglog_section) does a lot of the same h/t [@stefanjudis](https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1148232306735362056))
- https://github.com/winstonjs/winston
- https://github.com/pinojs/pino

- https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-node
- https://github.com/nuxt/consola
- https://github.com/baryon/tracer
- https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan
- [React Native CLI has very simple logging](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/3f116721eb30071b04a2957f8bd02a81954699de/packages/tools/src/logger.ts) with verbose mode you can still with just chalk dependency
- In Github Issue Templates, tell your users to report versions: https://www.npmjs.com/package/envinfo

You often also find specialized logger tools for each domain, like [@dazn/lambda-powertools-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dazn/lambda-powertools-logger) for AWS Lambda, but at their core they all support the core pattern of Log Levels `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` and `ERROR`.

// optionalDir for installing?
const prefixFlag = hasYarn() ? '--cwd' : '--prefix'
spawn.sync(['install', prefixFlag, optionalDir], { stdio: 'inherit' })
```
